# minesweeper

Minesweeper is fun isn't it? Here it is again but instead it uses Webpack for some odd reason. Weird.

# Usage

You _dont_ actually use it but ehh, if you want to play it, do it like this:

  1. install npm
  2. open a terminal at the folder and write `npm install` to install all prerequisites.
  3. write `npm start` to launch and play the game. It will automatically open a browser for you.
  
To play again, refresh the page, there's also no win and lose condition.
